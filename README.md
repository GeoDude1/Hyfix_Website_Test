# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Deployment (direct URLs: /home, /about, /applications)

This app is a single-page app (SPA). Direct visits or refresh on `/home`, `/about`, or `/applications` only work if the server returns `index.html` for those paths.

### Option 1: Node.js server (recommended)

Use the included Node server so `/home`, `/about`, and `/applications` work when entered or refreshed:

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start`

The server runs on port 3000 (or set `PORT`). It serves files from `dist/` and sends `index.html` for any path that isn’t a file (e.g. `/about`), so the SPA router can handle it.

- One command: `npm run preview` (builds then starts the server).
- **Deploy:** Use a Node host (Heroku, Railway, Render, VPS, etc.) and run `npm run build && npm start`.

### Option 2: Static hosting only

If you deploy only the `dist/` folder (no Node), configure the host so 404/403 serve `index.html`:

- **AWS S3 (static site):** Bucket → Properties → Static website hosting → **Error document:** set to `index.html`.
- **CloudFront:** Use a custom error response: HTTP 403 and 404 → respond with 200, body = `/index.html`.
- **GitHub Pages:** The build outputs `404.html` (copy of `index.html`); GitHub Pages will serve it for unknown paths.
- **nginx:** `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;`
- **Vercel/Netlify:** Add a rewrite so `/*` → `/index.html`.

After that, direct links and reloads on `/home`, `/about`, `/applications` will load the app correctly.
