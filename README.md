# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Deployment (direct URLs like /about, /applications)

This app is a single-page app (SPA). Visiting `https://yoursite.com/about` or `/applications` directly can show "Access Denied" or 404 if the host doesn't serve the app for those paths.

**Fix:** Configure the host so that **all routes** (or 404/403 errors) serve `index.html`:

- **AWS S3 (static site):** Bucket → Properties → Static website hosting → **Error document:** set to `index.html`.
- **CloudFront:** Use a custom error response: HTTP 403 and 404 → respond with 200, body = `/index.html`.
- **GitHub Pages:** The build outputs `404.html` (copy of `index.html`); GitHub Pages will serve it for unknown paths.
- **nginx:** `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;`
- **Vercel/Netlify:** Add a rewrite so `/*` → `/index.html`.

After that, direct links and reloads on `/home`, `/about`, `/applications` will load the app correctly.
